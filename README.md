<br/>✅ User can follow the sign in flow.
<br/>✅ User can tap the area for "Having trouble signing in?"
<br/>✅ User can log out from the Settings screen.
<br/>❌ Optional: Add a detail view for one of the files and implement favoriting the file. (did add detail view)
<br/>✅ Optional: Add UITextFields for the forms so you can actually type in them and handle dismissing the keyboard.
<br/>✅ Optional: You should be able to swipe through the welcome screens instead of just tapping them.
<br/>✅ Extra: made functional strength indicator

Continuing to work on the favoriting, didn't get a chance to finish today.

I spent about 9 hours on all the pieces. The most productive/helpful of which were the 3.5 hours on Saturday!
